# Orca

Orca is a minimal, extensible and light-weight web browser built in Rust with goals of speed, efficiency and rendering accuracy.

Orca is 100% free, and open-source. Development of Orca is made up entirely of volunteers and it would really help us out if you decided to volunteer, so please checkout the [Contributing to Orca](#contributing-to-orca) section of this document.

Orca is unstable alpha software. Use at your own risk!
